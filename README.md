# mitgcm_python
Python tools I built for MITgcm pre- and post-processing. They are designed for my Weddell Sea configuration, but should be general enough that other people will hopefully find them useful.

Disclaimer: I wrote this for an ocean application using a polar spherical (regular lat-lon) grid. It might not work for other sorts of grids, or atmospheric applications.
